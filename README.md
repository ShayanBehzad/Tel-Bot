# Tel-Bot
This Telegram bot gives the user the top ten news headlines and the user can access the full news and it's picture by selecting each headline.
Also, this robot can randomly send one of the posts or all the posts to the user from a channel that we have already created and put the desired posts in it
(For example, we can create a channel of a artist's songs and whenever the user sends the artist's name, we will send a song of that artist to the user).
This robot includes two parts PV and group (only private groups).
I got the news api from 'newsapi.org'.
I used python-telegram-bot for this project.
